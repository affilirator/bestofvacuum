With a dimension of 20 by 15 by 9 inches, Worx WG509 TRIVAC 12 Amp comes with exceptional features than most of its competitors in the market. [**Click here to see latest price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGX4SXW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07PGX4SXW&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=abbe19cf101678e1998b9caa56f22a86)

Worx has a very powerful motor. With 12 Amps, you are sure that this best leaf vacuum mulcher will not let you down along the way, no matter the amount of work.

The machine allows you to operate it using one hand. This gives you the liberty to use the other hand in doing other necessary mulching chores.

Thanks to its lightweight, you will not feel any unnecessary discomfort.

Another reason why I personally love Worx WG509 TRIVAC 12 Amp is the mulcher’s metal impeller that allows for a ridiculously 18:1 mulching ratio. This means that the vacuum blower comes with the ability to carry over 100 gallons of dry leaves, which in turn fit into a large collector bag that comes with this home appliance.

When Worx WG509 TRIVAC 12 Amp is in a vacuum mode, it has the ability to provide up to 350 cfm of volume. This is possible even if it is reaching some hard-to-reach areas such as under desks.

The blower mode provides an even powerful experience. You can adjust Worx WG509 TRIVAC 12 Amp from 75 mph to as high as 210 mph without any difficulty.

### Pros

-   It is a 3-in-1 home appliance. With Worx WG509 TRIVAC 12 Amp, you have a vacuum cleaner, mulcher, and blower.
-   You only need one hand to operate the machine.
-   It is powerful that you do not have to stop along the way to change tubes.
-   It uses electricity: no bad odor that comes in handy with gasoline-powered blowers.
-   The extra large collection bag will save you time that you would take to empty a small bag amid your work.

### Cons

-   Does not do better on wet leaves. Some of the leaves clog inside the machine’s propeller.
-   If not properly dried up before you storage, it will rust with time.

When BLACK + DECKER were designing this vacuum blower, they ensured they include a flexi-tube. This explains why it is easy to maneuver BLACK + DECKER BEBL7000 through the yard, collecting leave and debris.

This vacuum blower comes with the POWERBOOST. This feature is not found in any other vacuum mulcher. As the name suggests, the POWERBOOST enables you to get extra power whenever you need it to complete a certain heavy task. To get the power, you only need to press the POWERBOOST button.

### Types of Leaf Mulchers

Leaf mulchers are of 3 types:

### ***1\. Electric Mulchers***

These have to be plugged in to a power source with a power cable. Electric mulchers have an edge over gas mulchers, as these are lighter, cleaner and quieter.

As these do not use gas, the machines do not leak and can be stored easily. However, electric mulchers work better on smaller yards and do not handle larger yards too well.

### ***2\. Gas Mulchers***

Older mulchers are powered by gas. You can move these around freely, and these can work without power cords. You do not have to worry about drained out internal batteries.

These can be used for larger areas better than battery powered and electric mulchers. However, these have a lot more weight than their counterparts and the devices cannot be used when the weather is too hot. These can pollute the air and are noisier due to being gas powered. Gas mulchers need some amount of maintenance.

### ***3\. Battery Powered Mulchers***

These are equipped with a portable battery source that has to be changed before use. You can use them in a wider yard than electric mulchers, although not for as long or as wide as gas-run counterparts given that the battery might be drained of power.

You can run some mulchers in battery even when they are being charged. These are noiseless, quieter, eco-friendlier and allow more mobility. However, battery powered leaf mulchers are costlier than the electric or gas mulchers.

## What to look for when shopping for the Best Leaf  Vacuum Mulcher

Some standout features in a good leaf mulcher are:

**Speed** – Buy one with speed options. Get one with a slow and fast speed setting at least. Those with a slower speed do not clog and are great for piles of leaves as well as on delicate plants and flowers.

**Blade Quality** – Inferior blades, such as the ones constructed of plastic, have to be changed often. Superior blades, such as those constructed of metals, tend to last for more time.

**Motor specification and power** – The power of mulcher is measured in Amps. Look for a mulcher with 12 – 14 amps power. Those with a lower power makes it tough to mulch leaves well.

**Reduction Ratio** – It is the ratio of the original leaf volume to the volume of mulch formed. The best ones have 16:1 – 18:1 ratios.

**Capacity** – Those with varying capacities must match up to the size of yard you have. Larger capacities are needed for larger yards, and smaller for smaller yards.

Easy mode switching capacity – Go for mulchers that, while in operations, can be switched between vacuum and built-in leaf blower.

#### **Conclusion**

If you are looking for the **best leaf vacuum mulcher** on the market, these are worthwhile to consider. These leaf vacuum and mulchers are an attractive combination of useful features, top performance and affordable price. The best one is obviously one that suits your garden or yard size, specific requirements and budget. It is important to consider all such aspects carefully before making a choice.
