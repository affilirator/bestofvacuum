### **How to Choose the Best Vacuum for Shag Carpet.**

Keep these factors in mind when choosing the best vacuum for shag carpet.

-   **Weight** – Ensure that you have a [lightweight cleaner](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-lightweight-vacuum-cleaner-for-the-elderly/) in hand, which would make it easily portable and more convenient to use. One that is around 7 pounds in weight can be a good buy.
-   **Suction power** – Smaller models and wheeled units have a robust suction, which would be ineffectual for long carpets or pile rugs. Look for those with adjustable suction power. Also look for a vacuum cleaner that have a concentrated sealed suction, which is not very powerful.
-   **Cleaning mechanism** – You also need to look at how close the cleaning mechanism of your vacuum comes to your rug surface. If it is too high above the surface, it will be incapable of removing any embedded dirt or debris. On the other hand, a too low setting will make your carpet look fuzzy. This will damage a few areas, and make them look frayed in appearance.

-   **Adjustable height** – Keep in mind that extended cleaning with a vacuum not suited to your height can put undue strain on your body. A vacuum cleaner with adjustable height is recommended, as you can clean up more easily when you adjust the equipment to your physical stature.
-   **Power head** – Snagging can lead to tangling of fibers around themselves, making them useless. This can lead to overheating of the rubber bands of the bar, and make them snap ultimately. Look for a vacuum consisting of a detachable power head that can be removed while using on carpets. A self-propelled or lightweight cleaner with larger or oversized wheels can easily move over carpets, without sinking into the surface.
-   **Carpet rake** – With a long pile carpet rake, you can provide your carpets with a more effective cleaning when you use them gently in a back and forth motion. The action, although time consuming, can let you go around the fibers of the rug without causing any damage to them.

## **Cleaning Tips for Different Types  of Shag Carpets**

Find out how various types shag carpets are cleaned up.

### ***1\. Flokati Rugs***

Flokati shag rugs are a form of handcrafted wool rug that is made traditionally in Greece. Such kinds of rugs are typically of a cream or white color, although these can be dyed. These are made of 100% wool, which includes the rug backing. These shags are one of the fluffiest in form, and have a texture similar to a sheepdog. The rugs can get dirty quickly and easily and often need to be brushed and cleaned.[![](images/Flokati-Rugs.jpg)](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-shag-carpet/)

If you want to preserve the fluffy, soft appearance of the rug, you have to clean it up regularly – even before the rug turns dirty. Else, it will become yellow, messy and matted, and you will not feel like touching it. You have to follow the manufacturer’s directions or the tag, to know whether a specific spot needs special care, when you want to wash this rug.

Generally, you can clean these in a cool, gentle cycle with the softest wool cleaning soap. While washing the rug, do not use chlorine bleach, abrasive detergents or hot water at any time. These can harm and discolor the wool fibers in the rug. After washing it, air dry it. Never dry it in a dryer, as the wool fibers can be damaged otherwise. While air drying the rug, never try to dry it under direct sunlight. The wool can be discolored due to UV rays, and the process can be irreversible.

### ***2\. Wool Rugs***

Wool shag rugs are primarily of 2 types. The first one is the “Noodle” rug that has thick wool fibers shaped like noodles. This gives them the unique name. These have a luxurious and soft texture. However, the soft fibers tend to draw almost everything, such as hair, crumbs, dust and dirt. Thus, the rugs draw plenty of dirt and it is particularly tough to get them out. The tufts are attached to the backing only loosely, which makes them extremely convenient to draw out.

The “shaggy” wool rug is the second form of wool shag rug. These fibers are much thinner and are spaced much closer than the noodle rug. These small-sized shag rugs are knotted by hand with 100% natural wool. It is much easier to clean this type than the other one.

Due to their construction, cleaning them up with a standard vacuum is impossible. It would be disastrous to use a Dyson vacuum on the rugs. You will need an upholstery attachment or a canister **vacuum for shag rug** to clean up the sides of the fibers and those located row by row in between them.

### ***3\. Leather Rugs***

Cleaning up these rugs is slightly easier, as you can tidy up them with leather cleaner. It is a good idea not to put them in an area with high foot traffic, or where these are not exposed to pets, liquids or foods.

Using an upholstery add-on to clean it can let you spot clean it with the suction power of the Hoover. Never vacuum on the rug, as the leather pieces can be entrapped in the vacuum’s turning mechanism – leading to your rug being damaged. It is best to spot vacuum the area, without any risk of exposing the rug to the rotating portion.

### ***4\. Acrylic Rugs***

These have a cheaper appearance than wool, and are highly flammable in form. As these carpets dry up too fast, it is best to deep clean them. You can hire or purchase a deep cleaner and use a high-grade machine cleaning formula. Acrylic carpets dry up fast, and it is essential to give them sufficient time to be fully dried before being re-used. You should open up the windows and install fans to accelerate the drying process.

Although acrylic rugs are vulnerable to wearing down, most of them can be cleaned up in a washer without any damage. A man-made material, Acrylic does not show a good response to heat. You should make use of a warm iron for smoothening out the dents caused by furniture. If acrylic is exposed to heat, it can melt. You should use a brush instead to smoothen the tiny wrinkles and dents in the acrylic rugs. For the larger dents resulting from furniture, use a hairdryer.

Cleaning up this type of fabric is extremely similar to cleaning up any other type of rug surface, such as wool. You should deep clean an acrylic carpet after about every 12 to 16 months.

### ***5\. Synthetic Rugs***

Synthetic shags might not be rugs of the best quality. However, cleaning it can be an easier. This is because as compared to wool, these can sustain cleaning by a steam cleaner – for a few times at least. Although these are of lower quality and do not last for a long time, you can clean these up in this way.

Most synthetic based shags can be cleaned by washing them thoroughly by washing them in gentle, cold cycle and letting them be air-dried. Some of the specialized may need particular soap and cleaning methods.

### ***6\. Silk Rugs***

These rugs and carpets have a smooth, natural shimmer, and a soft texture that is unbeatable. Silk is mainly composed of a type of protein known as fibroin, which makes them astonishingly strong. Silk fibers, as far as tensile strength is concerned, can also match steel yarn. But it is essential to know how to clean them up properly. When wet, silk fibers tend to lose a lot of strength. Pure silk carpets are very expensive, and you should treat them with a lot of care.

You should call up a professional cleaner to deal with serious stains, and let experts deal with the problem. Less serious stains can be removed with home treatment. If you act faster, you are likelier to succeed. Do not wait for a liquid stain to dry before you remove it. Use a paper towel or an absorbent pad to blot as much spill as you can. Do not be tempted to rub it.

Fill up a spray bottle with a solution containing vinegar and water in equal parts, confirming that the solution is tepid or cool at most. Mist the affected carpet area heavily, and blot the moisture up. Repeat the method until you have fully removed the unpleasant stain. Then allow the carpet to naturally dry up.

#### **Conclusion**

The **best vacuum for shag carpet** is one that fits your budget and purpose. Top brands like Dyson, Bissell, Panasonic and Electrolux have some fantastic equipment on offer, as do other manufacturers. You should choose one that has all the features that you need, matches the cleaning requirements of the type of home you have and satisfies your budget concerns.
