## **4\. Hoover WindTunnel 2 Rewind Upright Vacuum**

[![Hoover WindTunnel 2 Rewind Upright Vacuum](images/Hoover-WindTunnel-2-Whole-House-Rewind-Bagless-Corded-Upright-Vacuum-UH71250-.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MTFTTQ2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MTFTTQ2&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=6122dcc7d30cb8c9c5c27c1dba35e6de)

Hover is a cleaning supplies specialty brand, a company known for designing some of the best vacuum cleaners in the world. The Wind Tunnel 2 Upright Vacuum is a model that features a retractable cord. And it’s cheaper than Miele Complete C2 canister vacuum. So if you’re on a budget, or you just prefer an inexpensive vacuum cleaner with a retractable cord, Hover Wind Tunnel 2 would definitely make the best option. [**Click here to see today’s price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MTFTTQ2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MTFTTQ2&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=6122dcc7d30cb8c9c5c27c1dba35e6de)

### Features

-   Designed to offer maximum cleaning service, the Multi-Floor Brush Roll can get rid of dirt from different floors and all carpet types without scattering them.
-   The Extended Cleaning Reach allows you to clean the ceiling with ease. Of course, you’ll not use this feature often. But you’ll find it handy when you need to vacuum the ceiling. To be precise, you can extend the Wind Tunnel 2 up to 16 feet, so reaching out to the ceiling isn’t going to be a problem at all.
-   The 25-foot power cord can retract automatically to provide you with the ease of operation and storage.
-   The machine has the Pet Turbo Tool that cleans pet hair trapped on the surfaces of the floor and the crevice tool enables you to clean sharp corners and cracks with ease.

### Pros

-   The Multi-Cyclonic Technology maintains high power suction for a long time.
-   The power cord retracts automatically.
-   The unit’s extendable cleaning reach allow you to clean higher surfaces like ceiling with the least effort possible.
-   The machine has an odor absorption feature and the advanced technology of Pet Turbo to capture pet hair that could be stuck in crevices.

### Cons

-   One of the biggest drawbacks of Hover Wind Tunnel 2 is that its suction power tends to lower after a few months of use.
-   Another problem is that the hosepipe can clog easily, especially when the suction power starts to reduce. And this is something to expect, because less suction power means the inability to push dirt into the bin.
-   The machine sometimes produces irritating sound when the hosepipe gets clogged and fixing the problem can take a lot of your time.
-   The other challenge associated with this machine is the ineffective picking of pet hair in crevices, so you might have to use another object to pick them.

## **5.Bissell CleanView Rewind Bagless Vacuum With Retractable Cord**

[![bissell cleanview swivel rewind pet upright bagless vacuum cleaner, 2254](images/Bissell-CleanView-Rewind-Deluxe-Upright-Bagless-Vacuum-Purple.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LGS8CX2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07LGS8CX2&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=d0bc8391b23945d06f3ae130671209bf)

Bissell CleanView Deluxe Rewind is a masterpiece of a kind. Designed to last for long, and priced under $200 without compromising features and performance, this makes a good choice for budget buyers looking for the best bagless vacuum with retractable cord. [**Click here to see today’s price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LGS8CX2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07LGS8CX2&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=d0bc8391b23945d06f3ae130671209bf)

One of the things we love about this vacuum cleaner is that it has sufficient suction power to absorb hair, dust, and allergens from different floor and carpet types.

### **Features**

-   Bissell CleanView Deluxe features an Edge-to-Edge cleaning technology and edge bristle. And they are quite handy when it comes to vacuuming the corners of different floors as well as under furniture. Add to this the edge bristles, and what you get for the price is a vacuum cleaner that can even clean sharp corners of your room and along the baseboards with ease.
-   The scatter free technology, in addition to sucking up dirt and debris, ensures that dust doesn’t spread out on your floors. And you can use this vacuum to get rid of pet hair because it has a Triple Action Brush Roll that helps get the job done.
-   This model’s cord retracts really well, and fast. A simple press of the retract button automatically rewinds the cord, locking it in a compact space, and makes the vacuum easy to store away when it’s not in use.
-   The triple action brush roll, which is compatible with different floor types, removes dirty from any floor with ease. In addition, the vacuum has a multi-level filtration mechanism, which traps allergens and dust.

### Pros

-   Bissell CleanView Deluxe doesn’t just vacuum floors; it also keeps a room free from dust and allergens that cause respiratory infections.
-   The power cord is 27 feet, long enough to vacuum a larger room without the need to unplug and plug it in a different power outlet.
-   The cord retracts nicely, and the whole unit is easy to store away when it’s not in use.
-   Bissell CleanView Deluxe doesn’t make a lot of noise during use. You can vacuum your house with the assurance the little noise it makes won’t disturb people in the room.

### Cons

-   The machine is quite functional for the most part, but it has a few challenges, including the clogging of the cord, which happens when the size of dirt particles gets big.
-   We wish it were easy to empty the canister. It’s not. You have to fit your hand inside the dustbin, loosen the nut that holds the canister in position, clean it, and then put it back in place. Quite tiring, but it’s a process you need to master if you wish to use this vacuum cleaner.
-   Bissell CleanView Deluxe is heavy, so it may not be an ideal choice for frequent movement. However, Bissell makes the vacuum easy to maneuver by ensuring that the retractable cord is long enough to allow you clean big room without actually lifting the vacuum cleaner.

## **6\. Bissell CleanView Vacuum With a Retractable Cord**

[![best vacuum with retractable cord](images/Bissell-CleanView-Plus-Rewind-Upright-Bagless-Vacuum-Red.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LGS8CX2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07LGS8CX2&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=2817912cef17e614d393eb10c9bedc2c)

If you’re looking for the best vacuum cleaner with retractable cord, an option that won’t break the bank, a pick that has all the bells and whistles for effective cleaning, then you should try the Bissell CleanView Plus. Whether you’re on a budget and you can’t afford Miele Complete C2 or you just prefer an inexpensive vacuum cleaner to a high-end model, the CleanView Plus should cut it for you. [**Click here to see today’s price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LGS8CX2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07LGS8CX2&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=2817912cef17e614d393eb10c9bedc2c)

### **Features**

-   This unit has a triple action brush and the integration of scatter-free technology to remove dirt from several types of surfaces.
-   Its mess-free dustbin attached at the bottom makes emptying dirt easy and its multi-level filtration traps debris from several surfaces
-   Bissell CleanView Plus is easy to adjust up to five unique heights that you can even use it to clean as high as 32 feet above the floor.
-   The cord rewinds automatically, easily wrapping in without you moving a finger. The powerful, multi-cyclonic suction easily captures dirt into the dustbin.
-   Bissell CleanView Plus has a multi-level filtration system with washable filters that easily get rid of dust and allergens.

### Pros

-   Bissell CleanView Plus is easy to use, especially because it’s lightweight enough to move around the house.
-   Bissell CleanView Plus has Triple Action Brush Rolls to remove the dirt and the Scatter-Free technology reduces the mess around the house.
-   The multi-level filters are washable, and this makes the machine durable and cost-effective.
-   The 25 ft. power cord allows you to move around the room without necessarily moving the entire vacuum cleaner.

### Cons

-   The machine works well but the challenge comes when your room has loads of pet hair and debris. The hose of the machine can get clogged at the bottom when the dirt being sucked in is heavy. This is a limitation that makes this device somewhat difficult to use.
-   The other problem with Bissell CleanView Plus is on the automatic retraction of the cord. You might have to stretch the cord far from the machine to ease the retraction, and the device seems to be pulling just a few feet at a time. You might find this annoying but at least it saves you the hassle of wrapping up the cord manually.

## **Retractable Cord vs. Standard Cord**

**Retractable Cord**

To say that vacuum cleaners with retractable cords are better than those with standard cord would be misleading.

The term retractable cord simply refers to the ability to fold down the cord of a vacuum cleaner with the click of a switch or a push of a button. And the benefit is minimal effort to fold the cord and easy storage even in a small compartment.

Understand that a vacuum cleaner that has a standard cord work well, just like the options that have retractable cords. The only difference is that you have to fold the cord manually. This, if anything, can be quite tiresome, not impossible.
