It’s a well-made, lightweight unit. And it has a number of premium features that make it a good option for vacuuming multi surface floors. [**Click here to see latest price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0771GVCV3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0771GVCV3&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=9f6a65be0a4bff1381680180a8da3a00)

### **Features**

-   The first and probably the most important feature of this vacuum cleaner are the cyclones. Located just above the 1.6-liter dustbin, they help to capture particles in a way that doesn’t compromise the hygiene around you. They are particularly important because they filter out even the tiniest particles, ensuring they don’t escape.
-   The suction power of this Dyson vacuum is also up to the standard. At the very least, you get around 250 air watts, which is more suction power compared to the 150 air watts of suction power than Dyson V10 provides. The Multi Floor 2 doesn’t have much suction compared to Dyson Animal 2, but what it gives you is still good enough to vacuum different surfaces with ease.
-   Because it’s heavy and somewhat tasking to push around, it might be best to use this [vacuum for a small apartment](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-small-apartment/). However, if the weight isn’t something that would bother you that much, then you can use on any room size anyway.
-   The self-adjusting cleaner head of this [Dyson vacuum cleaner](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-dyson-vacuum/) gives you the flexibility you need to clean different floor types with ease. Whether you want to clean hardwood floors, high pile carpet, low pile carpet, or shag carpet, the cleaner head will adjust itself just fine.

### **Pros**

-   A 250 AW suction is such an impressive power. At the very least, it’s up to 40% more than what Dyson V10 provides.
-   It has a dustbin capacity of 1.6 liters, which is quite big compared to what you get from other brands.
-   It comes with a number of accessories that enhance the cleaning process.

### **Cons**

-   At 15 pounds, this vacuum cleaner is heavier to carry from space to space in the house.

### **Features to Consider While Buying the Best Multi-surface Vacuum**

-   **Wet/Dry Capability**

When we talk about wet/dry capability of a vacuum cleaner, we’re actually referring to the versatility of the device. Like you can vacuum your area rugs and carpets and then sterilize hard flooring with just the flick of a switch. Also, make sure it provides enough air watts, because, at the end of the day, you need enough suction power to pick up debris of all sizes.

-   **Filter**

A vacuum cleaner will have different filters. But the most important one that an option you pick shouldn’t miss is the HEPA filter. It’s a standard filter system, well known and recognized worldwide for being human-friendly.

-   **Accessories**

Many vacuum cleaners come with additional accessories. And fortunately, manufacturers and seller don’t charge you extra for these. It’s up to you to decide how many accessories you’d like in a vacuum cleaner. This will help you to make the right choice in the end. For example, Dyson V10 Absolute comes with so many additional accessories while the likes of Miele and Sebo X5 only come with a few.
