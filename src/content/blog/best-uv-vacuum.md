## **What Are Dust Mites?**

Dust mites are small pests. It is not easy to identify dust mites using your naked eyes. In fact, it is even difficult with the help of glasses. Unless you use special magnifying glasses, chances of seeing dust mites are minimal.

Just imagine how hard it would to see a pest that is less than a millimeter. Scientists argue that an adult dust mite is a **half a millimeter**. If the size of a mature dust mite is that small, what of a juvenile dust mite?

The funniest part about dust mites is their body color. Dust mites are cream in color. As you well know, cream or bright colors are some of the colors many people prefer. Most houses here in the U.S are painted cream or any other bright color.

With a cream color, you can imagine how difficult it would be to spot a dust mite even if you had the powers to. As such, dust mites blend with the surrounding.

Although small, dust mites have 8 legs. Still, you cannot see dust mites. In fact, even when they are in a group, which is usually the case, you are likely to take them for a small pile of sand or dust.

The other thing you need to understand about dust mites is that they are not found in dirt homes alone. Well, it is true that dirty homes have more dust mites than clean homes. However, dust mites can invade a clean home fast. They build colonies within a short while, making it impossible for humans to breathe freely.

Dust mites feed on dead food. I mean, they thrive and survive on dead cells that fall from your skin. So, you can see that dust mites need you to be alive for their survival. They quench their thirst with humid air thus they do not need a glass of cold or warm water. That is how simple their life is!

## **How Do Dust Mites Affect You?**

A dust mite is not a bed bug. When I speak about bed bugs, perhaps you know I am talking about how painful they bite. However, you do not expect dust mites to behave the same. On the contrary!

Although dust mites might find their way to your skin, that is usually not their intention. Dust mites want to hide themselves in humid and warm environment and they find it close to the human skin. However, they prefer hitching on your clothes and beddings for the warmth.

If they don’t bite you, how do they affect you? The truth is, dust mites are one of the leading causes and spreaders of asthma in small children whose breathing system is fragile.

Many people who are allergic to dust usually are enemies of dust mites and not the dust itself.

When they die, dust mites can form a large pile on unclean parts of the house such as below tables, chairs, sofas, upholstery, and cabinets that are not cleaned from time to time.

In the end, if you let dust mites invade, accumulate, and thrive in your home, you will be breathing air that is full of dead dust mites. This air gets into your lungs through the nostrils. The result is having a weak immune system, which is potentially a health disaster. Alternatively, dust mites can even get to you via your skin. As you know, at this point, chances of getting eczema are high.

## **How Can You Avoid Dust Mites?**

A clean home is a no-go zone for not only dust mites but also many other microorganisms. Here are a few practical ways to avoid dust mites in your home:

***Vacuum regularly using UV vacuum cleaners –***regular UV vacuuming is a sure way of ensuring you destroy the conducive environment for dust mites. Again, at this point, you need a UV vacuum not just any other vacuum cleaner. If you find the best UV vacuum cleaner, like those in this list, be assured of eliminating dust from your beddings, seats, and shelves in your house and no day will you see dust mites in your house.

***Make good use of HEPA filters –*** remember, HEPA filters are designed with exceptional abilities to trap up to 99.9% particles. This way, you will minimize the chances of dust mites releasing allergenic enzymes into the air.

***Keep your home’s humidity levels as low as possible –*** while you might not have absolute control over this, chances are you can regulate the humidity levels of your house. Utilizing [dehumidifiers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VWHR7LQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07VWHR7LQ&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=45fc5fa64be15fd901ca6db310747a12) help in removing excessive water from the air (a crucial element for dust mites’ survival).

***Avoid cluttering your house –*** sweep all litter away as fast as possible. Whenever possible, have a litter bin set aside somewhere outside the house and clean it regularly.

***Use hypoallergenic bed linens*** – you may ask, “Why the hell should I use [hypoallergenic bed linens](https://www.amazon.com/Sheets-Pillowcases-Hypoallergenic-Bedding/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?rh=n:1063274,p_n_feature_seven_browse-bin:10671128011&linkCode=ll2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=dafff1cd7436192b59daa93281871648&language=en_US)?” or “What are hypoallergenic bed linens?” The simple answer is these are bed linens that are tightly-woven. The aim is to make it difficult for even the smallest particle or pest to pass through. Therefore, in case there are dust mites in the house, or somewhere close to the house, using hypoallergenic beddings helps curb the spread and the invading of dust mites to your bed. if possible try as much as you can to use linens, sheets, bed covers, pillow covers, and even seat covers that are tightly-woven.
