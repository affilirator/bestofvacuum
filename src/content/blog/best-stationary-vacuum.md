## Touchless Stationary Vacuum Cleaner Buyer’s Guide

A stationary vacuum cleaner is a modern and more efficient solution to handheld dustpans. What makes the difference between the two machines? A stationary floor vacuum is an automated dustpan that sucks dirt with the aid of a sensor, leaving no mess behind. It is a life-saver for people with very busy schedules or bad backs. The device is most common in salons and homes with many pets.

If you want to have the best stationary vacuum, you must put a few factors into consideration. After all, everyone feels happy if they get a machine that best suits your needs, here are some of the factors and features to look for:

-   **Style**

[![stationary vacuum reddit](images/best-touchless-vacuum.jpg)](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-stationary-vacuum/)

Stationary vacs are made as either built-in or free-standing. If you are looking to save on space or if you do not have much space then your best option would be the built-in system. Built-ins are common in bathrooms and kitchens due to the limited space.

On the other hand, most people who own salons and shops prefer the free-standing stationary floor vacuums. In my view, most free-standing vacuums have sleeker design. Whichever way you choose, style is a personal preference.

Most stationary vacuums do not hold as much dirt as full-sized uprights. They are much smaller therefore have slightly smaller capacities. Generally, built-in vacuums hold less waste than free-standing ones.

The best part of home stationary vacuums is that they do not require a large space. However, you can also choose which style you need from the many that are available in the market.

-   **Filtration**

Filtration is an important factor especially for people with allergies or those who have fur-shedding pets. Different vacuums have different filters.

Some vacuum cleaners are frilled while others are fluffy. They also vary in particle-capturing percentage. Majority of vacuum cleaners trap about 90-95 percent of dirt while a few trap about 99 percent of dirt. HEPA filters are the best because they offer 99.7% filtration. You can also get a few exceptions with recyclable filters.

It is a good thing to look at filtration details for they determine how clean your home can be.

-   **Motor**

A vacuum’s motor specifications determine its power usage and suction capabilities. The watts show how much power the motor utilizes and the number of amps affect other aspects such as indicator lights.

Initially, touchless vacuums were designed for commercial use. They were not very common in homes. This changed when people realized how effective the machines are. Today, many homeowners prefer touchless vacuum.

Manufacturers have seen the demand thus have designed more touchless vacuums for home use. Most of the touchless vacuums can be used both at home and in salons but some are designed for commercial purposes only.

-   **Indicator**

Anything that has an indicator is a lifesaver. With an indicator, you are able to know where you are headed to. Some indicators tell you what to do, the direction to follow and such like.

Touchless stationary vacuums’ indicators do not show you where to go. Instead, the LED light indicators inform you when the machine is clogged, something is faulty or when it senses dirt.

What else would you want than a modern machine that alerts you when it senses danger in the house?

**PS.**Not all touchless home cleaners have indicators; only the best stationary vacuums have indicators.                                                                                                                   

#### **Conclusion**

Whether you have a busy schedule, many pets, a hair salon to run, kids in the house or you are just looking to make work easier, it is quite clear that a touchless stationary vacuum cleaner is an important device. Choose one of these **best stationary vacuums** you have just read about and witness the difference – especially those tired of bending over with a dustpan.
