### Cons

-   I cannot find any downside as of now.

It is my belief that after going through my list of best vacuums for car detailing, you have been able to point out a few auto detailing vacuums.

Before you make the very last decision on the best car vacuum, I urge you to look at this last subtopic. It will certainly add value to the insights you have gathered from the above section.

## Tips On Choosing The Best Car Vacuum

In this section, I’m going to cover 8 pointers that you need to consider before you press on the ‘Add to Cart’ button in case you are shopping for the best vacuum cleaner for car detailing.

There are many factors to look before you make the payment but my list contains the most important factors.

### 1\. Motor Size

It is conventional that the bigger the size of the motor, the higher the performance. With that in mind, when choosing the best wet dry vac for car detailing, go for those brands whose motors are 10+ amps. These machines usually offer best services for long hours.

### 2\. Purpose For The Vacuum

This is a very important thing to consider. If you buy a vacuum for the sake of it, you will regret. Vacuum cleaners are designed to perform different tasks. In this write-up, I have covered auto detailing vacuums for your car.

Each of the vacuum cleaners mentioned above does better in cleaning your car. Although it may clean carpets, upholstery, and your house floor, you will realize that there’re vacuums specifically meant for that.

### 3\. Attachments

Attachments add value to the vacuum cleaner. Just as different tools and appliances make a home look complete, a professional car vacuum cleaner is incomplete if it lacks essentials such as crevice tool, brush roll, mounting hangers, and screws among others.

### 4\. Type of Vacuum

Yes, I have mentioned this shortly in the past. I’m not talking about things such as hand-held, portable or such like. This factor mentions the types of vacuum available. Hitherto, there’re three main types namely:

-   Wet/dry vacuum cleaner.
-   Steam vacuum cleaner.
-   Automatic/garage vacuum cleaner.

Each of the above vacuum cleaners is best in a specific task.

### 5\. Cord Length

Why should I consider the cord length? This depends on the size or the area of what you want to clean. The size of your car is also important.

If you intend to detail your family car with a hand-held vacuum that does not have a cord, it will mean you need to be as close as possible to the area you want to clean.

However, from my experience, most auto detailing vacuums come with long power cords. This helps especially if you have one of a few power sockets at your garage.

Some say that a longer power cord is clumsy but I do not agree with them. As long as the vacuum cleaner has the unwind feature, you shouldn’t worry.

### 6\. Wall Mount/Portable

As the names suggest, you can decide to purchase a car cleaning vacuum that you can mount on the wall of your garage or even somewhere inside your car or a detail vacuum that is portable.

The difference is that one has to be in a specific position while the other can be placed anywhere in your car.

### 7\. Weight

The best vacuum for car detailing does not need to be heavy. As you have seen, manufacturers are trying to design light vacuum cleaners.

The aim is to ensure their products as light as possible. A heavy car detailer vacuum will be cumbersome to handle. It will mean that only the ‘strongest’ person in your family will be able to use it.

On the other hand, if you consider a light auto detail vacuum, it will be easy for any family member to clean the car whenever the need arises. Auto detail vacuums that are below 10 lbs are highly recommended.

### 8\. Warranties

Would you not love the idea when a company tells you that you can take back the appliance anytime it develops a problem? Everybody will love to hear such kind of news.

When you are purchasing a car detail vacuum, it is important to look for the manufacturer that is willing to repair, exchange, or at least listen to you when the vacuum develops a problem. Car detail vacuums with 5+-year warranty are always given the priority.

#### Conclusion

It is my hope that you have identified the best vacuum for cleaning your car from the above list. Before you finally press the ‘Add to Cart’ button, look at all factors.

Do not concentrate on a single factor. In the end, I’ll be very happy to learn that I helped you get the best vacuum for car detailing.
