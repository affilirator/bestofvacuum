If you have a cat inside your house, you know how difficult it is to curb the spread of cat litter. Even if you have the most disciplined cat, kitten, or even the best litter box, cat litter will somehow scatter or get tracked somewhere outside the litter box. This is why you need the best vacuum for cat litter.

In their quest to see that their houses are free from cat litter, many homeowners have tried several ways. Many have been able to get rid of cat litter successfully and live to tell their story. A small number of others have failed to find a solution. The beauty is that there are homeowners who are not relenting in their quest for a solution to remove cat litter from their houses. Before I look at a solution to
that problem, here is a question we must answer:

### Does Cat Litter Ruin Vacuums?

“Ah! How is that even possible?” many people ask. Although it seems that there is no harm in using a vacuum cleaner to do away with cat litter, the truth of the matter is that even the best vacuum cleaner for cat litter can be spoiled fast.

Traditionally, vacuum cleaners are not meant to clean cat litter. The fact that it may help in removing away cat litter, does not really mean that it will do so forever.

Many cleaning experts and manufacturers know that cat litter can easily clog inside the vacuum cleaner’s system thus slowly reduce the machine’s ability to work effectively.

### Why Cat Litter Is Dangerous To Many Vacuums

Unless you get the [best vacuum cleaner](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-cleaner/) for cat litter and pet hair, chances are you will do your house more harm than good. Experts warn that cat litter destroys a machine because when it gets in contact with water, it molds together, just as cement does when it gets contact with water. You see! That is exactly what happens when cat litter catches a cold, mold, or even a little dampness.

Nonetheless, vacuum cleaner manufacturers are now slowly getting an antidote to this problem. The following list contains some of the best vacuums for cat hair and litter that can help you clean your house. But first, here is a comparison table for best cat litter vacuums.

### Things To Consider When Buying A Vacuum Cleaner for Cat Litter

After looking at a list that gives you a glimpse of the best vacuum for cat litter, it is time we delve at what you need to consider when choosing the ideal kitty litter vacuum.

-   **Suction Power**

The term suction power should interest you as it does the machine itself. When you are sourcing out your vacuum cleaner, you need to understand whether it has the ability to pick up the litter you need it to pick.

For now, your interest is if the vacuum at hand will pick cat litter. To be honest, if it’s going to take you the whole day to pick cat litter, how the hell are you going to complete your cleaning?

The number of watts in the appliance’s motor may measure suction power. However, this is not a guarantee.

-   **Portability**

You are not the only one going to use this vacuum cleaner. Well, you may be, but really, would you go for a 20+ lbs vacuum cleaner while there is one that has 2.5 lbs?

-   **Durability**

It is true that machines differ in size, shape, color, suction ability, features, and many other things. One of those many things is durability. It’d be a waste of money if you bought a vacuum cleaner that lasts a few days even weeks.

You may have spent little in buying it but if you buy many such products in a year, that’d be a lot of money thus wastage of family money that could buy something else.

-   **Corded Vs Cordless**

This is a point. Yes, users may opt to buy a corded vacuum because there are power sources everywhere in their house. What if you want to clean a large hall whose power source is stuck in one corner 120 feet away? Are you still going to buy a cat litter vacuum that has a 20-ft power cord?

### Practical Ways To Prevent Litter Tracking and Scattering Everywhere

Whether you are using the best vacuum for cat litter or the latest most affordable vacuum for cat litter, chances are litter may scatter. What will do to prevent this mess? Here are 3 main tips to help you prevent this from happening.

#### 1\. Use High-Sided Litter Box

Sometimes shit happens. This is even when we have the best gadgets around. Yes, because such things happen, it is possible that somehow, cat litter my scatter.

Some people have however found out that having a litter box with high sides will help a lot. Think about it: a shallow litter box will not work as much as a 3-ft tall litter box will.

#### 2\. Use Rags and Mats

This is a very ingenious was to track cat litter. By the way, if you are thinking that you are hiding dirt in your house, you are wrong. The aim here is to stop the litter from scattering.
