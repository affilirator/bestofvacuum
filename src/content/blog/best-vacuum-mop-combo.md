The best vacuum mop combo seamlessly combines the traditional cleaning method with the modern, producing a far more effective cleaning tool.

A mop may seem effective on its own, but it isn’t.

[![best vacuum mop combo](images/best-vacuum-mop-combo.jpg)](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-mop-combo/)

Yes, it will wipe the sticky grime off the floor better than a vacuum, but in the process, it disperses dust in the air.

Besides, it can’t remove fine dust off the floor or reach through cracks.

That’s where a vacuum comes in.

Vacuums may have a hard time dislodging hard-to-remove particles stuck on the floor.

However, they’ll effectively suck up the most minute dirt particles from the tiniest crevices.

Most of all, having HEPA filters, they won’t disperse dust back into the air.

Naturally, you’ll want to get the best of both worlds.

That’s why you need the best vacuum steam mop combo.

Besides giving you the benefit of a grime-cleaning mop and dust-sucking vacuum, it usually comes with several other features not found in ordinary vacuums.

## **Things To Consider When Buying A Vacuum And Steam Mop Combo.**

By now, you have a vast knowledge on how some of the top-rated vacuum mop combos work by looking at their features. But, that is not all. Before you make your decision, here are 4 things to put in mind:

### **1\. Size And Weight**

The size and weight of the vacuum mop combo to buy should be among the few things to think about. On the size, you need to know the amount of space the vacuum mop combo will occupy when storing.

Weight matters a lot especially when transporting it. The more the vacuum mop combo weighs, the more the shipping fees you will be required to pay.

Besides, weight should also a factor when you know upfront on who is going to use it. Prudence tells you that seniors and kids need a light vacuum mop combo compared to young adults and millennials who may have the energy to carry, push, and pull heavy machines around.

### **2\. Adaptability**

Not all vacuum mop combos can do various chores that you may need them for. While a robot vacuum and mop combo may be ideal in cleaning a hardwood floor, it may not give best results on carpets and rugs.

Additionally, it is good to look for vacuum mop combos that have the versatility of doing all things in one go.

It could be wastage of family resources if you bought a vacuum mop combo, a vacuum cleaner, and an air purifier while one machine can do almost everything at once.

### **3\. Steaming Time**

‘Time is money’, goes a popular quote. True to those words, you do not want to spend a whole day steaming or even cleaning a single room.

The best all in one vacuum should help you save time by cleaning the entire house quickly.

The best vacuum mop combo should take a short steaming time. This will help you spare time to do other important chores.

### **4\. Type Of Floor**

Although most vacuum mop combos work in many types of floors, a few of these machines are designed for specific floors.

It is wise that you know which vacuum mop combo works best in the type of floor in your house.

For instance, certain hardwood floors do not shine when you roll steamers over them. Besides, if the floor is not carefully fitted, some water may penetrate if let loose.

## **What Are The Benefits Of Having The Best Vacuum Mop Combo?**

There could be as many benefits of using the best vacuum mop combo in the world but it is utterly prudent to highlight some of the most important ones.

In this write-up, I’ll discuss 5 important benefits.

### **1\. Work Quickly Thus Save Time**

The best vacuum mop combo will help you save a lot of time thanks to its effectiveness and efficiency.

If you land on the best brand, it will be very easy to clean up even the most stubborn stains.

For instance, the 6 best vacuum and steam cleaner combo reviews above clearly show that most of the brands in the market are either 2-in-1 or all-in-1 home cleaning appliances.

This means they vacuum, steam, and mop all types of floors at one go.

### **2\. Kills Almost Everything**

While many vacuum cleaners in the market are praised for killing harmful microorganisms that include viruses, germs and bacteria, the best vacuum mop combo has the ability to do even more.

Most of the brands featured above have the capacity to kill even insects and pests.

A good example of a pest includes the microscopic dust mites that are hard to spot using the normal eye.

Most of the vacuum mop combos use steam thus are able to kill fleas, tics, ants and other pests that may invade your home.

### **3\. Hygienic Cleaning**

Vacuum mop combos use steam and heat, which are responsible for killing 99.9% of germs. Of all the home cleaning appliances available, vacuum mop combos are respected for killing even the most harmful microorganisms that usually lurk in houses especially in places that are hard-to-reach.

### **4\. Chemical-Free Cleaning**

An on-going debate about which does better between chemical and chemical-free vacuum mop combos, has revealed that the best vacuum mop combo is actually chemical-free. [**See our reviews for water based vacuums**](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-water-vacuum-cleaner/)

While some mop combos that use chemicals are excellent in cleaning hardwood and tiled floors, chemical-free vacuum mop combos have also proved to be giving sterling results.

Think of this for a moment, don’t you think that the less the chemicals used on floors, carpets, rugs and other upholstery where kids play is a safe way to avoid health complications?

Home cleaning experts advise that it is prudent to use chemical-free solutions to clean surfaces in houses with kids.

### **5\. They Purify The Air**

I know it sounds a bit strange to talk about air purification on a subject that deals with vacuum mop combos.

In really sense, some of the top-rated vacuum mop combos in this review help clean the air as you continue with the mopping.

Now you know the top benefits of using the best vacuum mop combo. But, there’s still another question that needs to be answered.

## Is there a vacuum that also mops?

Yes, BISSELL 2554A CrossWave Cordless Max All in One Wet-Dry Vacuum Cleaner and Mop is a vacuum that also mops.

## Is there a robot vacuum that vacuums and mops at the same time?

Yes, Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop and Bissell SpinWave Hard Floor Expert Pet Robot, 2-in-1 Wet Mop and Dry Robot Vacuum are some of the robot vacuums that vacuums and mop at the same time.

#### Conclusion

It is not a hard thing, as it may seem to find the best vacuum mop combo. You only have to carefully consider the best vacuum and steam cleaner combo reviews on the internet before deciding on the type of mop combo to purchase for your home.

In the end, may you find the ideal vacuum mop combo that will serve you to your satisfaction.
