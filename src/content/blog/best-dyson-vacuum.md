## 1\. Dyson Cyclone V10 Absolute

[![Dyson Cyclone V10 Absolute](images/Dyson-Cyclone-V10-Absolute-Lightweight-Cordless-Stick-Vacuum-Cleaner.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798FVV6V/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0798FVV6V&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=3f631eb1d375fbd84ab1749c9bd2606e)

Are you’re in the market for a vac that combines durability, aesthetic, and function in their right balance? Cyclone V10 Absolute is for you. It weighs just 5.9 lbs, making it one of the most lightweight options in Dyson’s stick vacuum series. Absolute’s three power modes boost lightweight and heavy-duty tasks. And the built-in twisters can easily capture debris of different sizes from all surfaces. [**Click here to see latest price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798FVV6V/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0798FVV6V&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=3f631eb1d375fbd84ab1749c9bd2606e)

### **Features**

-   Dyson V10 Absolute has three power suctions: low, medium, and max. These give you the flexibility you need for lightweight as well as heavy-duty vacuuming.
-   This unit uses a rechargeable battery to power the built-in digital motor. We recommend charging the battery for at least four hours before the first time use. How long the battery lasts depends on the suction mode you choose, with the low mode lasting up to 60 minutes.
-   The V10 Absolute features a big dust cup, making it a good option for vacuuming a larger area. In fact, it’s about 40% bigger compared to what you get with the  Dyson V8 model.
-   Although the fourteen twisters are tiny, they still exert the pressure needed to capture different kinds of debris from any surface.
-   Dyson V10’s soft roller head easily captures dust and debris, especially from delicate floors. And the brush head can help a great deal when deep cleaning your carpet.

### **Pros**

-   The V10 is one of the most lightweight vacuums in the Dyson models.
-   It has three unique suction modes.
-   You can easily convert it to a handheld vac.

The V11 Torque Drive is the best Dyson vacuum cleaner for someone who’s in the market for a vac with an integrated smart technology. It’s a lightweight device, just like the V10 Absolute. And it’s quieter during operation than many vacuum cleaners in the market. [**Click here to see latest price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NX8XBMP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07NX8XBMP&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=f2dfec40a0db932606dc9c23733c0245)

-   The LED light indicator at the back of the vacuum is a very important feature. It acts as a real time communication medium between you and the V11. At the very least, it lets you know the current power mode, blockages, the time to clean the filter, and the remaining runtime.
-   The Dynamic Load Sensor is one of  Dyson V11 Torque Drive’s strongest selling points. The smart technology automatically adjusts the speed of the motor depending on the surface you’re vacuuming. This integration takes away the need to adjust power setting manually, hence convenience.
-   Another impressive feature is the battery with a decent life. You get a runtime of close to 60 minutes, so you can do a lot of vacuuming with just a single charge.

If you look at the comparison chart, however, you will notice that every model is different from the other. And this necessitates a buyer’s guide. So, here’s what to look for before buying a vac cleaner from this brand.

**1\. Weight**

Dyson vacuum cleaners differ in terms of weight. If you’re up for a lightweight unit, the [Dyson V10 Absolute](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798FVV6V/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0798FVV6V&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=1557a459458c63c76f367abe4a78be0b),  [Dyson V11 Torque Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NX8XBMP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07NX8XBMP&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=3181b02ee8d3d3a0073e1c942bbc92c9) and  [Dyson V7 Motorhead stick vacuum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798B31TC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0798B31TC&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=ae543a51fdd6c838db00c0aff216dca9) are the best options to choose. Canister vacuums are somewhat bulky, so you need to keep this in mind when shopping for a model from the brand’s product lineup.

**2\. Body Style**

Dyson vacuums come in three different body styles: canister, stick, and upright.

Canister vacuum take a bit from stick and upright vacuum. It’s lightweight and it has a larger dust chamber. It’s also a suitable option for heavy-duty vacuuming.

A stick vac is easy to move around and you can even convert it into a Dyson handheld unit. However, they have a small dust chamber, which means you’ll have to empty it regularly for better performance.

An upright vacuum is a good option for removing almost any debris from different surface. Its large dust chamber makes it a good option to use in an environment where there’s a lot of dust and particles to remove.

**3\. Noise**

Noise level is an important factor to consider when choosing a vacuum from this brand. Of course, some models are quiet. And some are quite noisy when in operation. To be precise, cordless models tend to be quieter when in use but the upright vacs tend to make the most noise. Canister models, on the other hand, are somewhere in between.

**4\. Extra Features and Functions**

[![Dyson vacuum attachment tools ](images/Dyson-attachment-tools.jpg)](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-dyson-vacuum/)

-   Additional accessories like dustbin brush and stair tool
-   LED display for real time communication and interaction
-   A wall mountable docking station

**5\. Capacity of the Dust Chamber**

Dyson vacuum cleaners have varying dust chamber capacity. The standard range is between 0.5 and 2 liters. More often than not, handheld models have the smallest capacity while the upright models have the largest.
