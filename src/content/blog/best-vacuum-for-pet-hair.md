This is the best vacuum for cleaning up pet hair, dust and crumbs that is accumulated every day. It boasts of cyclonic action triple layer filtration system that can keep off dirt from the filter. The long-lasting suction power allows cleaning of bigger messes with ease. 

***Suggestions***

You have to discharge the battery completely for a whole house vacuum, although not during clean ups of spot pet hair and spills.

***Tips***

The crevice tool can easily pull out dirt and pet hair, but you need to be careful that it clicks properly into place. Otherwise, it will retract with any pressure on the end.

### ***Buyer’s Guide***

Although the unit comes with a nice look, there is an important flaw in its design. As expected, the on and off switch is place over the handle. However, there is a release for the filter in front of the switch that separates the front dirt-containment chamber from the rest of the unit.

You can confuse this easily for the on and off switch, which can lead to the detachment of the front section and its eventual falling off during usage. The moment you hit the release button, the whole front section straightaway drops to the ground. You have to remember this to avoid accidental drop offs from time to time.

***Pros***

-   The battery-powered vacuum can vacuum cars very easily, and the beater brush helps to pull up pet hair with a lot of ease.
-   The on-board crevice tool works perfectly, and can pull out dirt and pet hair with a lot of ease. It clicks properly into position.
-   It has a brush that flips into place, and directly hinges to the nozzle. When you need it, you do not have to look about for it.
-   It is slightly awkward to empty the vacuum for trash, although you can do it easily anyway.

***Cons***

-   The suction power is not as great as expected from cleaners from this brand.
-   It has a type of design that needs the vacuum to be vertically placed on the charger. This means more shelf or counter space is taken up.

#### ***Suggestions***

If you are doing more than spot cleanup or using the motorized brush for intense cleaning jobs, the battery can die very fast. Given that the battery life is not very strong, it can last for more time per charge when used without the on-board motorized brush.

***Tips***

It is a good idea to go through the manual, which emphasizes that you do not recharge until you have discharged the battery completely. Otherwise, the battery life would be reduced.

### ***Buyer’s Guide***

Given that the filter picks up a lot of dirt and grime, it is a good idea to give it a weekly cleanup in order to have it always ready for operations.

***Suggestions***

The cord of the **hair cleaning** device is not retractable. Nor does it wind around. Naturally, it is recommended that you use Velcro strips for the purpose.

***Tips***

You should stick the cleaning tool onto the nozzle over the motor directly, which would offer stability at the time of vacuuming floor or stairs.

Keep in mind that the cord is pretty long for use. There is no cord management or retracting feature, and you have to wrap it around the cleaner motor after you complete the cleaning operations.

#### ***Pros***
