### What Makes Shark Vacuum Great?

It is important to know that like other vacuum cleaner manufacturers, SharkNinja has been in the industry for many years. The company continues to stay afloat because of a number of reasons. In this write-up, I’ll address 5 reasons why you should consider Shark vacuum for pets to be your number one vacuum cleaner.

### 1\. Pricing

Contrary to the general opinion that price corresponds to quality, Shark vacuums are so far the most affordable. It is true that you can get other brands at a lower price but from my experience, most Shark vacuums for pet hair are affordable compared to their competitors.

You may argue that buying a vacuum cleaner at let’s say $299 is not affordable. Yes, I agree with you. But, what if you buy a vacuum cleaner that offers the same service with the exact features from a competing client at a cost of $499?

### 2\. Dual-Floor Capability

I bet you have used different types of vacuum cleaners and seen how each of them work. You will agree with me that not all brands you have used come with dual-floor capability. I mean, not all vacuum cleaners in the market have the ability to clean all types of floors, carpets, rugs, upholstery; furniture, stairs, walls, and even ceilings.

Interestingly, almost all Shark vacuums come with this capability. What is more, all the six Shark vacuums for pets listed  below come with this capability. What more do you need than a vacuum that helps you to clean every corner of your house?

### 3\. Maneuverability

If you live in a house filled with furniture, have two or more pet animals, and of, course your family, then you know an easy-to-maneuver vacuum cleaner is essential.

In a society where various investors need to get rich quickly without offering better services, it is easy to find substandard products. Vacuum cleaners with rigid steering and small tyres make it almost impossible to clean a congested room.

The beauty about Shark vacuum cleaners especially the best Shark vacuums for pet hair is that they all have Advanced Swivel Steering Technology. This technology, coupled with a number of other features makes it easy to clean even a house that is filled with all sorts of furniture.

### 4\. Upright Stature

Trust you me, all the Shark vacuum cleaners above are upright. You cannot begin to think of the benefits of having an upright vacuum cleaner in the house.

-   First, they do not require a big storage space. As long as you lean then against the wall or something that cannot easily fall, you are done with storing your Shark upright pet vacuum.
-   Second, [upright vacuum cleaners are the best for seniors](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-lightweight-vacuum-cleaner-for-the-elderly/) whose backs and joints do not need much bending. You see! Shark upright vacuums are the best for these senior citizens.

### 5\. Lightweight

Weight is perhaps one of the biggest factors you look at when purchasing a vacuum cleaner. Although most Shark vacuum cleaners for pet hair come with power cords, their weight is excessively low compared to other brands.

From the below list alone, you can get the best Shark vacuum for pet hair that is below 4 pounds! This is incredibly light and anyone can use it without complaining of their arms feeling the fatigue from the weight.

The entire shark vacuum for pets in the list below is sourced firm one manufacturer. The company under the name SharkNinja has preceded its reputation for supplying reliable and the best shark [vacuums for pet hair removal](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-pet-hair/) across families in the world. Either way this list is your best option to ensure your family is living in a hygiene and fur free homestead.

#### Conclusion

I hope you have seen that there is a lot that SharkNinja is doing to ensure your house is free from pet hair.

For you and your family to stay a stress-free life, pick one Shark vacuum for animal hair and you will never regret to have made the decision.
