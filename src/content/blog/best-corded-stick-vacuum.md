Everybody knows how stick vacuums work: they suck in dirt from your floors. However, what many people may not know is that only the best corded stick vacuum will ensure the sucked-in dirt doesn’t escape back into the air.

A [study by researchers from Queensland University](https://www.webmd.com/allergies/news/20120106/are-vacuum-cleaners-bad-for-health#1) of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, showed that poor quality and old vacuum cleaners are likely to release dirt into the air. The dirt will certainly contain bacteria and allergens, which will ruin your family’s health.

That’s why you need to replace your old corded stick vacuum.

## Top Rated Corded Stick Vacuums

Most importantly, you need to find the highest quality corded stick vacuum. The most critical feature of such a high-quality best corded stick vacuum is the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. HEPA filters are designed to eliminate 99.9% of pollen, animal dander, as well as bacteria from the air.

And that’s just one of the benefits of getting a high-quality corded stick vacuum.

Besides providing allergy relief by eliminating pollutants, such a vacuum cleaner also:

* Eliminates dust mites.
* Keeps your skin healthy and free from irritants.
* Makes your carpet last longer.
* Gives your home a fresh smell by removing bad odors.

But, perhaps the real question is why purchase a corded cleaner instead of a cordless one.

Here’s why…

A corded vacuum gives you far more suction power than a cordless one. That extra power means more thorough cleaning that produces a healthier indoor environment. Besides, you won’t be inconvenienced by having to charge the vacuum just when you need to urgently clean your house.

Even so, you still have to sift through multiple corded stick vacuums to identify the best quality you can afford.

To make your search as easy as possible, this guide lists 8 of the best corded stick vacuums. It features only vacuums with the best specifications and highest reviews from buyers.

All you have to do is pick one that matches your specific needs.
