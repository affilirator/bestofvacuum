## **How to Maintain Different Types of Concrete Floors**

All types of concrete flooring require regular cleaning and maintenance for the floor to remain in good shape.

The good thing about concrete floors is that they are relatively cheap and easy to maintain when compared to other types of modern floors.

With that in mind, you may ask, how the hell do I care for a stained or polished concrete floor? Well, I will look into that but first; here is what you need when cleaning your concrete floor:

-   Mild soap.
-   Clean water in a basin/bucket.
-   Cleaning detergent if any.
-   Concrete cleaner if any.
-   Mop on wax.
-   Finish wax.
-   Microfiber mop.

## **How To Clean Concrete Floors**

***PS**. With an exception of polished, sealed, and painted floors, all other concrete floors can accommodate the use of any detergent on them.*

*For the other concrete floors that include plain, stamped and stained concrete floors, you can follow this procedure when doing your daily, weekly, or even occasional cleaning:*

1.  The first step would be to mix water with a mild soap.
2.  If the floor has been dirty for days, you can decide to add a friendly detergent.
3.  Then, dip the mop into solution; squeeze it to remove excess water.
4.  You have to ensure the mop is moist and damp.
5.  Roll the mop on the surface of the floor putting away the area rugs and carpets if any.
6.  Ensure you remove any spills as fast as you can because if they stay longer, they will stain.
7.  You can do another round of mopping to ensure the floor is dry.
8.  For occasional heavy-duty cleaning, you need to repeat the above process but can also apply finish wax for shining after cleaning.

## **Fixing Concrete Floor Cracks**

Concrete floors suffer occasional cracks dues to poor construction, natural causes, or traffic on the floor. When such cracks appear, the prudent thing you can do is to act quickly to fix the matter.

A quality patching material is the ideal solution for minor flaws such as gouges, scratches, and cracks. However, if the cracks tend to run on a large area, you can decide to use an overlay.

Alternatively, you can put tiles on top of the cracks, something that will seal the cracks completely.

#### **Conclusion**

With best vacuum for concrete floors, you are sure that your floor will always have a sparkling shine that is required.

Good vacuuming will ensure your floor lasts longer without major problems such as widespread cracks. In addition, a clean floor will lead to a healthy family and of, course the pets in the house will love and enjoy staying with you.
