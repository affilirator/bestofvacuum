## Things To Consider When Buying A Vacuum Cleaner For Seniors

There are quite a number of things you should consider when you are purchasing a vacuum for a senior citizen. Apart from the usual things, you would look for if you were to buy for the whole family or for commercial use, the elderly need special attention, or let’s say, they need to use exceptional vacuum cleaners.

Here are 8 points to consider when you are on the verge of buying the best lightweight vacuum cleaner for the elderly:

### 1\. Type

How many types of vacuum cleaners do you know? There could be as many as over 20 vacuums. I will mention 9 vacuums that are common namely:

-   Upright vacuums.
-   [Backpack vacuums.](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-backpack-vacuum/)
-   Self-propel vacuums.
-   [Pet hair vacuums](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-pet-hair/).
-   Handheld vacuums.
-   Robot vacuums.
-   Sweeper or stick vacuum cleaners.
-   Deep cleaners.
-   Canister vacuum cleaners.

You will realize that each of the vacuum cleaners mentioned above is best in cleaning a specific place or thing in the house. Some of the best types of vacuum cleaners suited for the elderly include handheld vacuum, upright vacuum, because of the seniors’ back condition, and a stick vacuum.

Robotic vacuums are also becoming very common as the best vacuums for arthritis suffers. As the name suggests a robot vacuum works without any supervision. However, because of the sophistication involved in the setting it up, it might not suit all seniors.

### 2\. Power

Power is another point to consider. Conventionally, you need to look for a vacuum cleaner that does not consume a lot of electricity. However, a vacuum cleaner with a small motor will not perform optimally. If the vacuum is cordless thus rechargeable, you need to look for one that has a runtime of at least 45 minutes.

Suction power is another point. A vacuum cleaner that does not or has less suction power will not help seniors or any other person for that matter who is looking into cleaning their houses. When buying the best vacuum cleaner for bad back elders need to have a powerful suction ability.

### 3\. On/Off Switch Location

The best light vacuum cleaner ideal for the elderly should have the [![best vacuum for elderly](images/Oreck-Commercial-XL2100RHS-8-Pound-Commercial-Upright-Vacuum-Blue.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B001NDNV18/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001NDNV18&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=5e716cd9b1d8765ee617a8f9ed3b6b38)on/off button should be placed where the senior citizen will get access it with ease. In most cases, the best lightweight hoovers for the elderly come with the on/off switch at the handle like [Oreck Commercial XL2100RHS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B001NDNV18/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001NDNV18&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=5e716cd9b1d8765ee617a8f9ed3b6b38).

### 4\. Bagged/Bagless

Whether you will buy a bagged or bagless best lightweight vacuum cleaner for the elderly should depend on the amount of litter you intend to collect. A bagged vacuum cleaner will hold more dirt compared to a bagless cleaner. The disadvantage of some bagless vacuum cleaners is that you might be forced to stop along the way to empty them before you resume your cleaning work. This wastes time.

### 5\. Full Indicator

Without a battery full indicator, it is hard to know if the vacuum has charged to full capacity. It is easy to manage vacuum cleaners that come with LED indicators that alert you when you need to do something.

For instance, the benefit of knowing that the vacuum cleaner is fully charged helps in not only saving money thanks to the use of less electricity but also can be of great benefit to your vacuum cleaner. You will not leave your vacuum cleaner unnecessarily connected to power. This helps lengthen the life of the battery inside the vacuum cleaner.

### 6\. Self-Propel

With many people doing many things, little time is left to do a thorough cleaning. To help ease the tension many senior citizens, self-propelled vacuum cleaners are recommended.

The difference between a self-propelled vacuum cleaner and a robot cleaner is the size and shape each takes. Most self-propelled vacuum cleaners take up the normal upright stature.

Seniors who use robot vacuum cleaners do not need to push or pull the vacuum cleaner. They do not even need to be present in the room or at home when the vacuum does the cleaning. You only need to arrange things in the room to make way for the vacuum cleaner.

### 7\. Maneuverability & Weight

It would be impractical to speak about the best cleaners for the elderly without the mentioning of weight. Senior citizens do not have the energy as millennials or teenagers who may have the energy to push or pull heavier vacuum cleaners.

For this reason, you need a lightweight vacuum or if possible, an ultra-light vacuum cleaner like Shark Rocket DuoClean HV382. This will especially be ideal for seniors that have health complications such as arthritis, bad back, and other health-related complications. Check out our reviews for [best stationary vacuum](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-stationary-vacuum/), best option for people with bad backs.

The vacuum must also be easy to push or pull around. Vacuum cleaners with extra-large wheels are easy to maneuver between desks, chairs, sofas and carpets. When looking for a vacuum cleaner for a senior citizen, ensure that it is easy to push and the wheels do not clog unnecessarily.

### 8\. Retractable Cord

Is it important to have a vacuum with a retractable cord? Some would say there isn’t. In my view, a [vacuum cleaner that comes with a retractable cord](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-with-retractable-cord/) is easy to store. After use, you only have to press a button and the cord winds itself back to a safe compartment within the vacuum cabinet.

Although some types of vacuums do not come with a button, you can wind back the power cord to its place. Whichever way, it is easy for the vacuum’s storage.

#### **Conclusion**
