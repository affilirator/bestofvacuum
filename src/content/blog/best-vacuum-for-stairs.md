##  **10 Best Vacuum Cleaners for Stairs**

Here are reviews for vacuums that I have found to work best for cleaning stairs.

## **1\. Black+Decker BDH2000PL MAX Lithium Pivot Vacuum** 

[![best vacuum for stairs and furniture](images/BlackDecker-BDH2000PL-MAX-Lithium-Pivot-Vacuum-20-volt.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IOEFBKS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IOEFBKS&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=69b33f21371c0382f8c0a3215adf067a)

This is a noisy, but otherwise wonderful vacuum that allows easy each to difficult areas and makes the entire process enjoyable. [**Click here to see latest price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IOEFBKS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IOEFBKS&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=69b33f21371c0382f8c0a3215adf067a) 

### ***Suggestions***

It is best to use it as a spot cleaner, as it does not remove dirt embedded in shaggy rugs or fails to deep clean carpets.  **See [best vacuum for shag carpets.](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-shag-carpet/)**

### ***Tips***

Do not use it for cleaning your entire dining room or kitchen room floors. It should best be used as a spot cleaner for wood stairs, carpets etc.

### ***Buyer’s Guide***

It does not come with any attachments, which allows the convenience of not misplacing anything.

### ***Pros***

-   It has robust suction power and its nozzle rotates while also keeping suction maintained.
-   The vacuum head can twist in various directions, and you can easily reach the area under tables, difficult spots on the ceiling and more.
-   It has a 3-stage filter that keeps the air clean and prevents clogging.
-   When not used, its lithium ion battery does not lose charge. Also, through the entire charge cycle, there is minimal fading of power.
-    Black+Decker BDH2000PL needs small space to be stored up.

### ***Cons***

At 94.4 dB, it can be too loud for comfort unless you live in a generally noisy environment.

## **2\. Shark Rocket Corded Hand Vac (HV292) Vacuum**

[![vacuum for stairs](images/Shark-Rocket-Corded-Hand-Vac-HV292.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P9Z36T8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00P9Z36T8&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=86505d49dd0082609330c62d979e3bd4)

This is undoubtedly one of the best handheld vacuum for stairs, and can be used to remove dust, small spills, cat hair etc in moderate amounts from any spot. [**Click here to see latest price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P9Z36T8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00P9Z36T8&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=86505d49dd0082609330c62d979e3bd4)

### ***Suggestions***

It has a 15-feet power cord which can be a little short at times. You can use an extension cord with the model.

### ***Tips***

After you wash the filter, let it air-dry to prevent the growth of mildew and mold on it.

### ***Buyer’s Guide***

The unit lacks a retractable cord. However, you may wrap the cord around the cleaner.

As the vacuum has its handle at the end, use it only for occasional spot cleaning. Any more usage can worsen problems such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

### ***Pros***

-   Until its dirt cup is nearly full, it does not lose suction power.
-   Its hose attachment is flexible and nice. It has a dusting brush and a crevice tool fitting on the hose.
-   The motorized brush on the vacuum can easily remove pet hair from couches or stairs. You can easily set this brush up.
-   Shark Rocket Corded Hand Vac (HV292) can be easily and quickly assembled.
-   At 5 pounds, it is lighter than most other vacuums available on the market.

### ***Cons***

-   Its filters lose effectiveness with each wash, and finding replacement filters can be tough.
-   The hose does not fit the model upright, and sharing accessories between them is impossible.

## 3\. Tineco A10 Hero 350W Cordless Vacuum Cleaner

### **What Makes a Specific Vacuum a Good Choice for Cleaning Stairs?**

Various factors go into deciding which  stair vacuum is a good choice. You have to get one that can be maneuvered precisely and easily. You should also check the following:

-   **Light weight** – vacuum for stairs should be lightweight so that it can be easy to reach difficult places and also be  transported conveniently. Go for lighter units, preferably with detachable canisters. It is best to opt for those that are less than 10 pounds in overall weight.
-   **Longer cord** – Look for those that come with longer cords – so that you do not have to break your operations after every few feet. While cleaning stairs, a long corded vacuum with rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries can allow power-free operations. Some people like to go for 2-in-1 vacuum cleaners.
-   **Long hose** – Make sure that its hose is long enough, and there are enough nozzles to clean the stairs without the need to move the device.
-   **Features** – Go for one with features like an assortment of brushes, crevice tools, varying pivoting degrees, portable canisters, various attachments and the ability to rotate 180 degrees. The hose and the crevice tool should be 3 ft long at least. Special HEPA filters and multiple brushes can help reduce allergens too.

## **Corded Handheld Vacuums**

It is best to choose vacuum cleaners with long cords for tidying up stairs. The last few years have witnessed a shift in the market for vacuums, and cordless varieties have come into popular usage. Although some people like to use cordless handheld vacuums, these are not very good for stairs – usually for the following reasons:

-   **Short battery life** – Unless you go for the really expensive ones, you have to do with a short battery life on a single charge – which is usually around 15 minutes. That might not be enough if you have hardwood stairs or two or three floors to cover.
-   **Costly** – These are often expensive, and come at a premium price. You can find it tough to get a good one that costs less than 200 USD.
-   **Low power** – As these are battery operated, you cannot often get the kind of suction and power that can be expected from corded units that run on AC outlets. The really powerful ones are typically expensive. Most of these are better for spot cleaning, and lack the features or capability to offer a deep cleaning experience.

## Handheld corded vacuum

Are the best choice for vacuuming the stairs, and cost-effective as well. These  vacuums never run out of power, and are perfect for longer cleaning operations or larger spaces. Unlike the latter that run for only about 15 – 30 minutes, you can operate them for longer time. Those that run on batteries often need around 12 hours to charge up to 100% again.

Although you have to deal with more noisy operations, tangled cords and charging outlets, these offer far more power than cordless units. You can usually get much higher suction power and pick up more amount of dirt, debris and other types of rubbish at one go. Usually, battery power determines the amount of suction power that can be expected from a vacuum cleaner.

The handheld varieties are portable as well, and you do not suffer from strain on the hands during prolonged operations.    These are very light and compact in design, and generally weigh less than 10 or even 5 pounds. When you choose a model that is of the right size and height for you, the operations can be far easier. The cleaning results can be better as well.

However, some top brands such as Dyson are bringing out cordless handheld vacuums that can offer more suction power and can run for longer time. These are very light in weight as well, which means they are not painful to use or carry for extended time.

#### **Conclusion**

That was all about vacuums for stairs, and a lowdown on some of the best vacuum models for cleaning up stairs. The best vacuum for stairs for your home will depend on your individual preferences, budget, expected features, type of design, length of stairs and the type of stairs that you have – wooden, carpeted, non-carpeted etc. Your choice should be guided by such factors, which are important for making the best choices for satisfying your own cleaning requirements.
