Long human hair or pet hair can be a hassle to vacuum. Well, unless you have the best vacuum for long hair.

Long hair – just like pet fur, pollen, lint, and skin flakes shed by humans and pets, are source of food for dust mites. Those nasty creatures are the most common cause of allergy from house dust. Certainly not the type of pest you can tolerate in your house.

Fortunately, vacuum cleaners that are good for long hair will also eliminate everything else.[![best vacuum for long hair](images/best-vacuum-for-long-hair.jpg)](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-long-hair/)

The key characteristic of such vacuums is the powerful suction. This ensures both large, small or stubborn particles are sucked off the floor. Plus, they have highly effective HEPA filters to trap allergens and dust.

And they don’t easily get clogged up like Shark Navigator (ZU561).

That’s a particularly irritating issue in low-quality vacuums, which can turn a 5-minute vacuuming session into a miserable 30-minute ordeal.

Most importantly, you need a vacuum that’s not only fast and effective, but also safe.

The good news is there exist a collection of vacuums with excellent hair removal capabilities. These include upright, stick, corded and even robot vacuums. That gives you the freedom to pick one that suits your needs when it comes to cleaning long hair.

### **Review**

Dyson V8 Stick Vacuum Cleaner is rechargeable. Perhaps, this is the first reason why it takes the lead in this list. It is also portable and can clean up carpets from deep inside.

[**Click here to see today’s price on Amazon.**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B06XG7WKKL/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06XG7WKKL&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=6b297b8e5d3abf6d9c3aa7a032b82330)
