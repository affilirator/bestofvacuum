Water vacuums or water filtration vacuums are becoming quite popular. The great thing about these vacuums is they use water as a filter and they can filter more things and not lose suction.  Debris such as pet hair, [long human hair](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-vacuum-for-long-hair/) get sucked and trapped in the water instead of getting trapped in a filter. You’re basically water washing the air when you use the best water vacuum cleaner.

But, what is a water vacuum cleaner? How does it work? I will explain these questions in detail later in this article. For now, here is what you need to know:

A water filtration vacuum is just like other vacuum cleaners. It distinguishes itself from the rest because it **uses water as its basic cleansing agent**. A water-based vacuum cleaner has an in-built water tank, which is usually big enough to hold a lot of water. The tank acts as a pressure agent.

**You might also be interested in [best multi purpose steam cleaner](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-multi-purpose-steam-cleaner/).**

Dust particles, dirt, allergens, and other germs are extracted from various surfaces into the water tank, which later dissolves the dirt before it is removed into a separate collector tank. You will learn more on how a water filtration vacuum cleaner works later. For now, here is a comparison table of 3 best water vacuum cleaners.

### **What Are The Key Advantages Of A Water Based Vacuum?**

Now, let’s know why you seriously need a water-based vacuum cleaner. It is after knowing the advantages of water vacuums that you will be in a position to choose the best water vacuum cleaner. Here are 6 advantages of using vacuum cleaners that use water:

### **1\. Great For Pet Hair**

What is the use of a vacuum cleaner is it doesn’t help clean pet hair and dander from the house? One of the biggest advantages of a water filter vac is that it is superior in eliminating pet hair.

No matter how much your pet sheds hair, water vacuums are powerful enough to collect even the lightest pet hair. Their suction powers are far much beyond any other types of vacuums.

Perhaps you are wondering why and how perfect water based vacuum collects pet hair. Remember that pet hair is trapped in water thus, there is no room for escape. Once the pet hair absorbs water, it becomes heavy thus cannot be tossed away by air.

### **2\. No More Clogged Filters**

Remember that vacuums that use air filters are prone to clogging. When these machines are at work, they draw pet dander, hair, and any other dirt including dust to the filter. As the amount of dirt increases in the filter, chances of this compartment clogging are extremely high.

[![water filter vacuum cleaner](images/Kalorik-Blue-pure-water-filtration-vacuum.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1NHQFV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01M1NHQFV&linkCode=am2&tag=bestofvacuum2-20&linkId=154b25c593effb1ac55858e520a36cb3)

A vacuum cleaner with water filtration system uses a different approach. By using water to trap all forms of dirt, which in turn is washed away, water filtration vacuums easily end the clogging menace.

The result is what should be of interest to you. Instead of wasting time to regularly clean, repair, and purchase new filters, invest in the best water vacuum cleaner.

### **3\. Great For Home With Allergies**

If your household is struggling with allergies, the antidote is looking at water filter vacuum brands. The best way to know if this is the right choice is to think of how other types of vacuums work.

Vacuums that use alternative means to trap dirt and dust always leave a loophole for certain amounts of dust to escape. It is not the case with vacuums that use water. These cleaning appliances suck all the available dust to their water reservoirs with no room for escape. This way, they seal any chances of allergies spreading.

### **4\. Purify The Air**

All water filtration vacuum cleaners in the market today have an extended feature that make them stand out: they purify the air. Yes, I know this may sound alien to you if you have never used a water based vacuum but, it is time to try it yourself.

I know of many people who have opted to buy a water-based vacuum cleaner and do not see the need to spend extra money to purchase an air purifier. What an ingenious way to save money to other use!

### **5\. More Flexibility When Cleaning**

It is noteworthy to mention that it is easy to move around with a water-based vacuum cleaner than alternative vacuum cleaners. One reason why this is possible is that you do not have the hassle of pushing or pulling the cleaner with a dust cup or a filter bag.

Moving around the house becomes pleasantly easy when you know that you do not have to stop along the way to empty a filled dust tank or a filter bag.

### **6\. Great For Spills**

Each day presents itself differently. Today, you may wake up well, prepare and leave for work and come back without spilling anything on the carpet. However, no matter how careful you may be, there will be a spillage of some kind on the floor. Tea, coffee, yogurt, or even milk can slip from your hand and fill the entire floor. The situation is even worse if you have kids or pets in the house.

A vacuum cleaner that uses water is best in everyday spills. This machine has been designed with special suction power that easily and quickly sucks and dries up liquids from any surface.

After hauling many praises to vacuum cleaners with water filtration system, you may wonder; does it mean that water-based vacuum cleaners do not have limitations? Hardly!

### **What Are Some Of The Downsides Of Water Based Vacuum Cleaners?**

Virtually, there is no single thing on Earth that is all known to be ‘smooth sail’. Although some things may possess many advantages over disadvantages, it doesn’t mean we overlook the lesser tier. Here are some of the notable downsides of using water filtration vacuum cleaners:

### **1\. Heavy To Carry**

You should not be surprised when I say that however best your choice is, water filtration vacuum cleaners are heavy. These home cleaning appliances require heavy compartments to hold several liters of water. Because of the water, which is key in these vacuum cleaners, it becomes inevitably heavy to pull or push vacuum cleaners that use water.

Trust me; it is difficult to carry some water filter vacs upstairs.

### **2\. Unusually Big**

A big vacuum cleaner may not be a problem to some people. However, water based vacuum reviews reveal that almost all the machines in the market are unusually big. Yes, they are bigger than traditional vacuum cleaners.

With their size, it requires that you have a large room where you can store the machine. Finding enough space where you can store large home cleaning appliances and other machines for home use is a daunting challenge to many people today.

### **3\. Expensive**

Water filter vacuum cleaners are good at their job. But, it is also important to note that most of these appliances in the market are expensive compared to traditional vacuum cleaners. It is true that high-end appliances do not come easy, but it will be difficult to get the best water vacuum cleaner if you are on budget.

#### **Conclusion**

Having a clean home is not an easy thing. You must do your research to find the best water vacuum cleaner. Thankfully, this article has helped you find a water vacuum cleaner that meets your desired needs. As you enjoy your cleaning, ensure that you do not leave any spills behind.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

## **What Is A Water Vacuum Cleaner?**

A water vacuum cleaner uses water as its main filter. By using water, this home cleaning appliance filters things such as dust, germs, and allergens faster than traditional vacuum cleaners. The best water vacuum cleaner hardly loses its suction power.

## **How Do Water Vacuums Work?**

![best water vacuum cleaner](images/best-water-vacuum-cleaner.png)

Typically, water vacuums utilize incoming dusty air that enters the water tank. Inside the water tank, the dusty air mixes with a solution that has been put already. A powerful motor then rotates the solution, which in turn separates the dust and any other dirt from the water that is used to clean it.[](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-water-vacuum-cleaner/)
While there is a complex mechanism that takes place inside a water-based vacuum, the appliance allows for two things to happen.
A water filter vacuum cleaner provides room for oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon to pass through. After this, dirty particles and dust that by now has bonded with water get trapped inside the chamber thus are dripped back to the basin.
Open the basin to empty the dirty water, which by now contains the dust particles, germs, allergens and any other dirt that has been removed from the house.
To continue cleaning other sections of the house, pour clean water into the vacuum’s tank and carry on.
