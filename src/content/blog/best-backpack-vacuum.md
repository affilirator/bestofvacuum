## Why Use a Backpack Vacuum

## What To Look For When Choosing the Best Backpack Vacuum

Like many other appliances for home use, you should be keen when choosing for a vacuum cleaner. As mentioned above, not all vacuum cleaners in the market today perform the same function. Some are superior to others while others have certain attributes that are not present in others.

What are some of the things you should look for when choosing a vacuum cleaner?

### **1. Power**

A good vacuum cleaner should not be that which consumes a lot of energy. There is no doubt that in some countries, electricity bills are always high. Therefore, you should always look at a vacuum that does not consume a lot of power.

While most of those in the market have 500W to 3,000W, I’d advise you go for a vacuum with a power consumption of 1,400W.

### **2. Weight**

Weight is a big factor. If you have a heavy backpack vacuum, then you know how tedious it is to move around with it. Ideally, you need a vacuum that is below 10 lbs. If you find a powerful, vacuum cleaner weighing around 7 or 7.5 lbs, the better.

### **3. Comfort, Easy To Carry** [**![best backpack vacuum cleaner](images/backpack-vacuum-cleaner.jpg)**](https://www.bestofvacuum.com/best-backpack-vacuum/)

Nobody doesn’t want to be comfortable. With a backpack, you are assured of the comfort. You will not even feel the 10 lbs on your back. Besides, a backpack vacuum comes with straps to ensure firmness and stability.

### **4. Features**

Yes, although some of the things mentioned above may amount to features, there are specific details you may want to look at. Some of the things you much look at are:

* Filtration power.
* Dust cup.
* Power cord vs cordless.
* Dustbin capacity.
* Cord length if any.
* Height (adjustable or not).
* Brush roll on/off.
* Variable power setting.
* Telescoping Wand.
* Upholstery tool.
* Crevice Tool (Attachments).
* LED Light.

#### **Conclusion**

Overall, which best backpack vacuum cleaner you should go for ultimately depends on your choice and the various benefits that the devices come with.

If you want to use the backpack vacuum machine for cleaning up your carpets, or only pet hair, or simply floors, you have to buy a unit that does the work in an appropriate way.

It is hardly a good idea to buy a cleaner without considering your daily cleaning purposes and requirements. Once you have factored in all such things,  be assured of better cleaning equipment.
