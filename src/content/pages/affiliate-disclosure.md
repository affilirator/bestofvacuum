## How We Fund Our Website  
To keep BestOfVacuum.com running, we participate in affiliate marketing programs, including:  
- **Amazon Associates**: We earn commissions on qualifying purchases made through our affiliate links.  
- **Retail Partner Programs**: We collaborate with trusted brands and retailers, earning a small fee if you buy via our links.

> As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. This means that if you click on a link on this site and make a purchase on Amazon, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you. This does not affect our editorial independence or review ratings.

And quite fortunately, these commissions come at **no extra cost to you** and help fund our research, testing, and content creation.  

## Our Promise to You  
### Unbiased Reviews Above All  
Our revenue streams **never influence** our reviews. Our team tests products rigorously, and we prioritize your needs over affiliate partnerships. Paid promotions or sponsored content are **clearly marked** to maintain trust.  

### Strict Editorial Standards  
Every product recommendation undergoes:  
- Hands-on testing by cleaning experts.  
- Analysis of performance, durability, and value.  
- Comparison with competitors to ensure fairness.

## FTC Compliance & Transparency  
We adhere to **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** guidelines by disclosing affiliate relationships. You’ll find clear disclosures:  
- At the top of articles/reviews with affiliate links.  
- Beside individual product links.  
- On this earnings disclosure page.
