# Our Mission & History

Founded in 2010, Vacuum Expert Reviews has spent over a decade helping consumers make informed decisions about vacuum cleaners and cleaning technology. Our mission is to provide the most thorough, unbiased, and scientifically-backed vacuum cleaner reviews on the internet.

## Our Testing Methodology

Every vacuum we review undergoes at least 20 hours of hands-on testing across multiple floor types and home conditions. Our standardized testing protocol ensures consistent, reliable results across all products we evaluate.

Key aspects of our testing methodology include:

- Suction power measurement in air watts and kilopascals
- Filtration efficiency testing for particle capture rate
- Noise level measurement in decibels
- Battery life testing across multiple power settings
- Ergonomics evaluation by multiple testers
- Cleaning performance on multiple surface types

## Our Team

Our team consists of certified professionals with academic credentials in relevant fields including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and indoor air quality. Team members have prior experience working for vacuum manufacturers, consumer testing labs, and academic research institutions.

## Editorial Independence

We maintain strict editorial independence and never accept payment for reviews or allow manufacturers to influence our testing results. When we use affiliate links, we clearly disclose this relationship, but it never impacts our ratings or recommendations.
